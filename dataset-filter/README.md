This code is designed for filtering the american metric system from a mathematical data set with translation errors. If a data set have both american and european metric systems mixed in a sentences without doing the transition (for instance mile x 1.6 = km) it would confuse the model. To solve this problem this script basically deletes each row which includes terms like; mile, dollar, feet... and makes the data set more clean.

Before running the code beware for the column names. If the dataset's column names are different than 'query' and 'response' add the new column names to the code.
